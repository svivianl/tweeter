# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## Final Product

The user can only like a tweeter after they are logged-in.
If a message is displayed under  the navbar, to make it disappear, you need to click the message.
